!Series_summary = Liver cancer is one of the most lethal cancers worldwide. Liquid biopsy provides a noninvasive approach in detecting and monitoring cancer biomarkers to overcome current limitations associated with tissue biopsies, comprising the analysis of circulating tumor-derived material. In this study, we profiled plasma cell-free RNA-seq to identify recurrently dysregulated RNA biomarkers for the liquid biopsy of cancer.

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Libraries were prepared according to Illumina's instructions accompanying the RNA Sample Kit (Cat.Nos. 634414 ), SMARTer Stranded Total RNAseq-Pico Input Mammalian kit (Clontech). First, total RNA is converted to cDNA, and then adapters for Illumina sequencing (with specific barcodes) are added through PCR using only a limited number of cycles. The PCR products are purified, and then ribosomal cDNA is depleted. The cDNA fragments from Protocol D are further amplified with primers universal to all libraries. Lastly, the PCR products are purified once more to yield the final cDNA library.
