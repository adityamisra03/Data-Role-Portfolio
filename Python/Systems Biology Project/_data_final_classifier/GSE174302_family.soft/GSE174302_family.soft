!Series_summary = We sequenced cell-free RNA (cfRNA) for five cancer types (colorectal cancer, stomach cancer, liver cancer, lung cancer and esophageal cancer) and healthy individuals in 230 plasma samples collected from 6 clinical centers in China.  Cancer related signaling pathway and microbial genus were identified. Cancer detection and specific classification were achieved through combining both host and microbial cfRNA reads.

Remeined reads were mapped to ERCC's spike-in sequences, NCBI's UniVec sequences and human rRNA sequences sequentially. GC oligos introduced in reverse transcription were trimmed off, after which reads shorter than 30 nt were discarded.
!Sample_data_processing = STAR (version 2.5.3a_modified) was used to map clean reads to the hg38 genome index built with the GENCODE v27 annotation
!Sample_data_processing = Duplicates in the aligned reads were removed using Picard Tools MarkDuplicates (version 2.20.0)
!Sample_data_processing = The count matrix was constructed using featureCounts11 v1.6.2 with the GENCODE v27 annotation, transcripts with uncertain coding potential annotation extracted from mitranscriptome, circular RNA annotation from circBase, Promoter, enhancer and repeat regions frm UCSC Genome Browser. Reads mapped to mitochondrial RNAs were excluded.
